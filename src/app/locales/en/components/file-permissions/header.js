    dataAccessIntro: 'The decision whether an authenticated user is allowed to perform the requested operation on files depends on a series of security checks on different levels.

    dataAccessPosix: '<strong>POSIX permissions</strong> are typical for Unix or Linux systems for specifying access rights to files or directories. However, there is one important nuance in Onedata implementation â€“ all space members are treated as a virtual group which is the <strong>group</strong> owner of all files in the space. This means that whenever a file is accessed by a space member who is not the owner of the file, the <strong>group</strong> permissions are considered. Permissions for <strong>other</strong> are considered when a public share is accessed (as an anonymous guest).',
    dataAccessAcl: '<strong>Access Control Lists (ACL)</strong> are a mechanism for regulating access to files and directories using hierarchical rules that grant and deny granular operations for a specific principal. An ACL is an ordered list of <strong>ACEs (Access Control Entries)</strong>. Oneprovider evaluates ACEs strictly in the same order as they were added, top-down. If any of the ACEs denies or grants access to the considered principal, evaluation is stopped. If there is no matching ACE, access is denied.',
