A file or directory marked as a dataset offers additional features, such as optional data and metadata protection or the ability to create persistent snapshots of the physical dataset contents. In case of a directory, a dataset covers all its subdirectories and files. Datasets can be nested, allowing users to compose arbitrary hierarchical structures.',
