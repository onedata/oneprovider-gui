    intro: 'Datasets allow the space users to organize their data into collections with desired granularity. A file or directory marked as a dataset offers additional features, such as optional data and metadata protection or the ability to create persistent snapshots of the physical dataset contents. In case of a directory, a dataset covers all its subdirectories and files. Datasets can be nested, allowing users to compose arbitrary hierarchical structures.',
    guide: 'This view presents a summary of datasets concerning the selected file/directory. It can be individually marked as a dataset with optional write protection settings, nevertheless all ancestor datasets (ones that contain the file/directory) are also considered when determining the effective write protection â€“ presented in the top-right corner. This is depicted in the below table, which allows manipulating the settings for each dataset in the hierarchy.',
